# Lab 5: Data Quality and Validation
This repository includes Task 1-3 that focuses on two powerful tools:

Great Expectations – A data validation framework that helps ensure data integrity and consistency. Cleanlab – A tool for detecting and correcting mislabeled data to improve model performance.

By working through this lab, I gained hands-on experience in identifying data issues and enhancing dataset reliability, which are critical steps in any data science or machine learning workflow.
